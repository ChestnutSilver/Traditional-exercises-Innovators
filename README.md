# Traditional-exercises-Innovators
#### Introduction

A research team for the development of software for learning traditional Chinese exercises based on virtual reality. All participants attend Tongji University, Shanghai.

#### Goal pursued

We hope to complete the design of a software in one year.(2022.3-2023.3). The function of this software is to teach traditional skill methods. The target group is high-level people who are under great pressure, like exercise and need to relax in life. (called "exerciser").

In this year, we will complete most of the technical contents of this project in the first half (or even the first three months). Because in the later stage, we need to use this project to participate in a wide variety of competitions, including "College Students' Entrepreneurship and Innovation Competition", "Challenge Cup", etc. The best result is the award above the national second prize. Of course, it is difficult. However, as long as we prepare carefully, even if we can't get very high-level awards, we can accumulate some scientific research and competition experience for ourselves, which is the most precious and important.

If possible, we hope to contribute to core journals (e.g., SCI, etc.) under the guidance of our tutors. It is also expected to apply for patents for our research results.

#### Members

As of the Spring Festival in 2022, our project has 1 mentor and 4 members. More details are provided in the project declaration.

- Zheng Hao is the main person in charge of the project and has a good understanding of the technical details, implementation scheme and future direction of the project.
